# periodic_table_of_elements.tsv

This file is based on a [GitHub project by Goodman Sciences](https://gist.github.com/GoodmanSciences/c2dd862cd38f21b0ad36b8f96b4bf1ee.js).

The data was downloaded on 27-Jan-2021.  It was reformatted as follows:

 * Only the fist 18 data rows were retained.
 * Commas were replaced by tabs.
 * Independent discovers were indicated by `|`.
 * Discovery teams had spaces replaced by `_`.
 * An `id` column was inserted at the front of each row,
   * with a copy of the element's symbol.
